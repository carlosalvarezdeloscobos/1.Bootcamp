1. First step determine the names for the new information columns (title columns)

3. Find the unique ticker and total volume stock for each ticker
4. From the column of unique tickers (column 11), find the last row
5. Find first date (open) and last date (closed) since we do not know at which particular date the stock open or closed for each stock
6. Find the open value, close value, yearly change, 5 change
7. Format cells


I could not find a solution when open value/ closed value =0 (vba outputs and error)
